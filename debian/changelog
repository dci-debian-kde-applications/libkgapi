libkgapi (2.0.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Team upload.
  * Add Vcs-* headers.
  * Link in as-needed mode.
  * Exclude kdepim-runtime from the shlibdeps, as this is a library (so its
    users will have the dependency) and it would prevent using it in
    kdepim-runtime itself.
  * Add Homepage header.
  * Do not force a multiarch library directory for installation, since kde4libs
    and kdepimlibs libraries are not multiarch (and probably will not be).
